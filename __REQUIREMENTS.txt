Scenario

        and there is no specific button on its homepage to highlight this option.

Exercise: Wireframing the project

    In this exercise, you will create a wireframe
        of the homepage incorporating this feature.

    Use Figma.

    Step 1: List the client's requirements

        Content blocks

            * About Little Lemon
            * Highlights and specials
            * Descriptions and photos of dishes
            * Navigation bar
            * Footer
            * Testimonials

    Step 2: Create the frame and grid

        Create a 1440 x 2900 frame
        Add a 12-column layout grid to the frame.

        Construct content blocks using rectangles and name the sections.
            Navigation bar
            Hero section that showcases the Little Lemon restaurant
            Highlights section showing the week’s specials
            Testimonials

        About
        Menu

        Add a button so the user can go to the order online page.
